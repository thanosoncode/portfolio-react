          <p>
            I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use
            and built with best practices. The main area of expertise is
            front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web
            apps, coding interactive layouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life
            in the browser.

          I love coding and the feeling that comes with building something by
          yourself. When I build something new, I usually learn something in the
          process.
