          <h2>A bit about me</h2>
          <p>
            Last year I was fortunate enough to be in a lockdown and started
            thinking of ways how to fill all these extra hours. Luckily, I found
            out about code!{" "}
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            I did a few courses, got frustrated, didn't want to see code again,
            the usual staff. But somehow I insisted and things slowly started
            making a little sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            I loved the learning process and the feeling that comes with
            building something by yourself. Bringing ideas to life in the
            browser from an empty folder is amazing!
