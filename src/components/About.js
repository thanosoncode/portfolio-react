            Last year I was fortunate enough to be in a lockdown and started
            thinking of ways how to fill all these extra hours. Luckily, I found
            out about code!{" "}
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            I did a few courses, got frustrated, didn't want to see code again,
            the usual staff.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            But somehow I insisted and things slowly started making a little
            sense.

            I loved the learning process and the feeling that comes with
            building something by yourself.

          Bringing ideas to life in the browser from an empty folder is amazing!

          Currently, I enjoy working with React and Styled Components having
          things nice and organized and implement best practices.
