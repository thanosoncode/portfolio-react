          <p>
            Last year I was fortunate enough to be in a lockdown and started
            thinking of ways how to fill all these extra hours. Luckily, I found
            out about code! <br />I did a few courses, got frustrated, didn't
            want to see code again, the usual staff. But somehow I insisted and
            things slowly started making a little sense.
          </p>

            I loved the learning process and the feeling that comes with
            building something by yourself. <br />I like how I can start from an
            empty folder and gradually bring ideas to life in the browser.

          I currently enjoy working with React and Styled Components having
          things nice and organized and implement best practices.
